# Scenario B1: a new validator joins the network. The new validator should be able to sync up to the head.
# - Set up: start 4 sonic validators, 2 RPC nodes and 2 observers.
# - Test: process transactions for 5 minutes, then create a genesis. Add a new validator syncing using the genesis.
# - Validation: check list of validator and validate final state of nodes
