# This scenario similuates a minimal network comprising only a single validator
# running one application generating a small number of transactions.

# The name of the scenario
name: Sanity Check for Main

# The duration of the scenario's runtime, in seconds.

# 2 static validators, nothing else.
# Currently hard-coded to always add 2 static scenarios. 
# This is the initial assumption when switching to privatenet(testnet).
# This is to be changed.
nodes:

# In the network there is a single application producing constant load.
applications:
  - name: load
    type: counter
    start: 10          # start time
    end: 50            # termination time
