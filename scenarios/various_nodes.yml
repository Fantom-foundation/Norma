# This scenario simulates a network with growing number
# of nodes. It deploys one application and sends rather high
# number of transactions. It observes if the throughput of the network
# is growing.

# The name of the scenario
name: Various Number of Nodes

# The duration of the scenario's runtime, in seconds.
duration: 600

# The number of validator nodes in the network.
num_validators: 1

# The network scenario to exercise. 
nodes:
  # Gradually increase the number of nodes
