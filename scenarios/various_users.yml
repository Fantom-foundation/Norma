# This scenario simulates a small network
# running the simple Counter application
# with various number of users (i.e. accounts sending transactions)
# and rather high tx/s.
# It tests how many transactions can pass through
# application layers from the RPC endpoint to block processing
# and how many transaction is Opera able to accept.

# The name of the scenario
name: Various Number of Users

# The duration of the scenario's runtime, in seconds.
duration: 600

# The number of validator nodes in the network.
num_validators: 1

# In the network there is a single application producing constant load.
