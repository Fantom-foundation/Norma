# This scenario similuates a small network running a few thousand
# transactions on a small number of nodes and applications.

# The name of the scenario
name: Dev Network

# The duration of the scenario's runtime, in seconds.
duration: 60

# The number of validator nodes in the network.
num_validators: 3

# The network scenario to exercise. 
nodes:
  # We include three additional non-validator nodes for the full duration.
  - name: A
    instances: 0

# In the network there is a single application producing constant load.
applications:
  - name: app
