# This scenario simnulates a minimal network required after changes to privatenet(testnet).
# There is no node in the nodelist, and 2 static validators should be added by norma controller.
# This is to be used as a sanity check, and expanded to other scenarios.

# 2 static validators, nothing else.
# Currently hard-coded to always add 2 static validators. 
# This was the initial assumption when switching to privatenet(testnet).
# Most likely, will be changed
nodes:

# In the network there is a single application producing constant load.
