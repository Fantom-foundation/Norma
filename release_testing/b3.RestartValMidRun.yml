# Scenario B3: a validator crash (via kill command) and restart. This tests recovery of a validator node.
# - Set up: start 4 sonic validators, 2 RPC nodes and 2 observers.
# - Test: process transactions for 5 minutes, then then stop a validator and remove it from the validator list.
# - Validation: check list of validator and validate final state of nodes
